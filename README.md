 # Hi there, I'm Sazi! 


 
#### Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst | Based in South Africa | Passionate about Defensive Security & Automation | Open to Opportunities



I'm a curious and driven learner with a mission: to understand how systems work so I can build robust defenses for them. I enjoy deconstructing complex security challenges and engineering practical, automated solutions.




## 🚀 Current Focus & Job Status

I am actively seeking entry-level or junior cybersecurity roles where I can contribute, learn from experienced teams, and grow into a proficient security professional. I am immediately available and bring a hands-on, project-driven approach.




## 🛡️ My Core Tech Stack & Tools

Python 3.13 | Microsoft Azure | Microsoft Defender | VirtualBox | PowerShell | Git & GitHub | Firewall & Network Security




## 💻 Featured Projects

Here are the hands-on projects where I apply and develop my security skills:


## 1. 🛡️ SentinelSweep-SOC | Intelligent Exposure Assessment

A production-grade, defensive security automation platform built for Security Operations Centers (SOCs).

- The Problem it Solves: Traditional network scanners create alert fatigue by flooding analysts with data. SentinelSweep-SOC adds contextual intelligence to distinguish critical risks from background noise.

Key Features & My Role:

Built a smart triage engine in Python that performs checks (like banner grabbing) to auto-downgrade low-risk findings (e.g., RDP with strong authentication).

- Implemented the REACT Principle for alerts, ensuring every finding is Reliable, Explainable, Analytical, Contextual, and Transferable.

- Designed Defender-safe, rate-limited scanning to avoid disrupting production systems.

- Created multi-format reporting (JSON for SIEMs, CSV for analysts, HTML for executives).

- Integrated MITRE ATT&CK mapping to frame technical findings within a strategic threat context.

- Tech: Python Sockets Multi-threading MITRE ATT&CK PowerShell Automation Windows Task Scheduler



## 2. 🔒 The Credential Shield Protocol (CSP) Integration Research

Exploring integration of a privacy-preserving credential audit protocol with exposure assessment.

- The Vision: Pairing exposure data (what's open) with credential intelligence (if the passwords are known to be breached) for a complete risk picture.

My Research & Conceptual Design:
    
- Investigating how to combine the exposure findings from SentinelSweep-SOC (e.g., open SSH/RDP ports) with a "server-blind" protocol like CSP.

- Planning an architecture where the discovery of a service could trigger a secure, private check against breach databases.

- The goal is to identify not just an "open door," but an "open door where attackers already have the key."

- Concepts: Cryptographic Protocols Privacy-Enhancing Tech (PET) Credential Hygiene Risk Correlation



## 🌱 What I'm Actively Learning

- Advanced Python for security automation and tool development. (Google IT Automation With Python Certificate)

- Defensive security operations, threat intelligence, and incident response workflows. 

- Cloud security fundamentals, particularly in Microsoft Azure.
